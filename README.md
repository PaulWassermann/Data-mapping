# Data-mapping

### Context

I realized this project as part of a recruitment process for an internship at EDF.

### Features

This small application allows a user to upload a .csv file (see user guide to learn how it should be formatted) and view the data within it on a Mapbox map.

Filtering options and data checking are available.

### How to use

Download the project and open the "index.html" file in your browser (preferably Google Chrome).
